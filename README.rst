====================

Documenting design space for new cryptocurrencies.

Summary
=======

This document describes potential distinct (but perhaps non-orthogonal)
features, with a short rationale for each potential feature.  Each feature
has a label of the form ``F<N>`` where ``<N>`` is a number unique within
this document.

Much of the ideas here start as deltas from `bitcoin`_ design as a source
of inspiration.

Please feel welcome to fork!  I value forks with diverging ideas over
spending much time arguing about merges. [#]_

.. [#] Note, this means the feature identifiers may collide, so `git` revisions will save us, so long as the hash function holds up.
